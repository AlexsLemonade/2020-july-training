## Getting Started

### Pre-workshop Prep

* Please review the [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md).
* Please ensure your installations of the [required software](software-setup.md) are working and take a look at how we intend to use during the workshop (see below).
* Ensure that you can log in to our RStudio server ([rstudio.ccdatalab.org](https://rstudio.ccdatalab.org/)). 
If you forgot your password, [send us an email](mailto:training@ccdatalab.org) or DM a CCDL staff member on [Cancer Data Science Slack](https://ccdatalab.org/slack).
* _Reminder:_ The training waiver you signed during the previous workshop applies to all CCDL training.

Please review at our procedures for using communication platforms throughout training (some things may have changed since last time!):

* [Zoom procedures](../virtual-setup/zoom-procedures.md)
* [Slack procedures](../virtual-setup/slack-procedures.md)

## Schedule

<!-- Introduce general schedule here -->

**For more details on the schedule for each day, [click here](SCHEDULE.md).**

## Workshop Structure

A description of our plans and goals for the workshop can be found on the [Workshop Structure document](workshop-structure.md). Please also refer to the [schedule](SCHEDULE.md) for information about timing and links relevant to each day. An overview of the modules we will cover and associated links can be found on the [Workshop Materials document](workshop-materials.md).

During instruction sessions, CCDL staff will lead you through course material using [Zoom](../virtual-setup/zoom-procedures.md), [Slack](../virtual-setup/slack-procedures.md), and [RStudio Server](../virtual-setup/rstudio-login.md). We will record instruction and provide it to workshop attendees so they can revisit it outside of workshop hours or in case they experience disruptions during live instruction.

During [consultation sessions](resources-for-consultation-sessions.md), CCDL staff will be available to answer questions and provide 1:1 assistance as you work through exercise notebooks we provide or work with your own transcriptomic data. Weâ€™ll mainly use Slack for these sessions, too.
